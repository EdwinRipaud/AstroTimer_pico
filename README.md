# AstroTimer_pico
A DIY intervalometer designed to be handy to build and use. Controllable directly or remotely, it will simplify your astrophotography sessions.


## Hardware
This project is based on a Rapsberry Pi Pico 2W on top of a custom made PCB. 
This combo can handle the timer configuration functions through physical interface and a remote interface, with a self hosted AccessPoint and an HTTP server.

## TODO list
* ~self hosted Access Point asn HTTP server~
* simple webapp timer control
* add webapp Pico configuration
* add webapp full sequance and Pico monitoring
* add physical output interface
* add physical input interface

* make a 'build-all.sh'
